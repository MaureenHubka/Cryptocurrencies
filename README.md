# Cryptocurrencies
Module 19 Challenge

# Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The companny has requested a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The data needed to be processed to fit machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what was being looked for, unsupervised learning was used and to group the cryptocurrencies clustering algorithm was used.

The following deliverables were accomplished and inlcuded in the file below and data visualizations are presented to share findings with the board.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
